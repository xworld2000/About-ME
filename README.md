"About Me" 

I'm a 40 year old brown man aspiring to matter in a world of forgotten souls. I just want to make something that will last a lot longer than my organic tissue. I long to breath life into something that will touch many. If only I'd studied harder in College. If only I'd graduated from high school. Through music creation and travel I was able to see the disparities in income and lifestyle. I figured out that I'm supposed conquer any and every discipline it takes in order to achieve some form of eternity, or die trying. All I understand is the grind.
